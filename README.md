# Knights-Travails 
#### The project focuses on finding the shortest path a Knight can travel from it's initial postion to the target position!
#### It uses a BFS (Breath-first search) to find the shortest path.
#### For example calling the function *knightMoves(startingPosition, targetPosition)* will find the shortest path: 
```
knightMoves([0, 0], [7, 7]);

You made it in 6 moves! Here's your path:
[0, 0] < Initial Position
[2, 1]
[4, 2]
[6, 3]
[4, 4]
[6, 5]
[7, 7]
